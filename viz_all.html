        <h1>Worldwide Trends in Covid-19</h1>
        <p>This series of visualizations helps illustrate trends in Covid-19 since January 1, 2020. It helps users gain an understanding of the trajectory of the virus (in terms of cases, deaths, hospitalizations, etc.) as well as society's response to and handling of the crisis. Users are also able to draw relationships between a society's policies and its Covid-19 outcomes.</p>
        <p>There are two data sources for this project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/covid-19-government-response-tracker"><em>Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)</em></a>, created by the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford. This dataset provided information on government policies amidst the pandemic</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data"><em>Our World in Data Covid-19 Dataset</em></a>, created by the organization <a href="https://ourworldindata.org">Our World in Data</a>. This dataset provided information on daily and cumulative cases, deaths, hospitalized patients, ICU patients, tests, and vaccines administered. It also includes data on the economy, some health characteristics (e.g., prevalence of diabetes and smoking), and the countryâ€™s level of development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, the country polygons, in GeoJSON, were taken from <a href="https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries">https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries</a> and simplified using <a href="https://mapshaper.org">mapshaper</a>, reducing the file size from 23 MB to 9 MB.</p>
        <p><a href="#definitions">Definitions</a> of all of the attributes are given at the bottom of the page. Note that, for ordinal variables, in cases where policies vary within a country (e.g., mask-mandates, etc.), the strictest value is chosen, combined with the suffix "-Local". Nation-wide policies have the suffix "-National".</p>
